## 🐍 Step 1: Install Python

1. **Download Python**  
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   - Click the “Download Python” button (latest version recommended).

2. **Run the Installer**  
   - Open the downloaded installer from your Downloads folder.  
   - ✅ IMPORTANT: Check **“Add Python to PATH”** before clicking **Install Now**.

3. **Verify the Installation**  
   - Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows).  
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```  
   - You should see the installed version, like `Python 3.x.x`.

## 🧠 Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. **Download VS Code**  
   - Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
   - Download and install it for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).

2. **Run the Installer**  
   - Open the downloaded file and follow the setup instructions.

3. **Install Python Extension**  
   - Launch VS Code.  
   - Open Extensions view (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).  
   - Search for `Python` and install the **official extension by Microsoft**.

4. **Run a Sample Program**  
   - Create a file named `hello.py` and add:  
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```  
   - Right-click and choose **“Run Python File in Terminal”** to see the output.

## 🧪 Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment *(Optional but Recommended)*

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   In your project folder, run:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```  
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Packages**  
   You can now install packages using pip, like:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
   When done, run:  
   ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
